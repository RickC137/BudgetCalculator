# BudgetCalculator
This application is supposed to simulate a vulnerable budget calculator application.
This application is NOT SECURE!!! and should only be used for practice, I am using it
only for practicing how to find bug bounties. It is a work in progress so not everything
is done and there plans to be many changes, including a fully working more secure version
running at endpoint api/secure which will show the best practices on how to resolve certain
vulns.
